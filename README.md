Color-Coded-Per-User-Story-and-Task-Boards
==========================================

These two SDK 2.0 apps color code the Story or Task card headers to reflect work ownership per User Name.

There are two types of apps here - the ones that require no user name hardcoding, for the average team (colors assigned randomly to up to 11 team members), and the one that requires hard coding changes for those teams that NEED to be able to assign each user color themselves.

To use the name hard-coding apps, simply edit the code at the bottom of the app to set the user names of YOUR team's members.  Change up the colors how you'd like using HTML color names or Hex color codes.

See the header of the actual code for details.
