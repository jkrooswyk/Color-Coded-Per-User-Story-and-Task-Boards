Color-Coded-Per-User-Story-and-Task-Boards
==========================================

These 2 SDK 2.0 Apps color code the Story or Task card headers to reflect ownership per User Name.

To use the apps, simply edit the bottom of the code to include the user names of YOUR team's members.  Change up the colors how you'd like using HTML color names or Hex color codes.

See the header of the actual code for details.
